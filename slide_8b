-- Bash Scripts --

If you find yourself running the same set
of commands in a row over and over, consider
writing a bash script to automate it.

Name your file `something.sh`
Make the first line a "shebang" ->
    #!/bin/bash

And then write the commands you want to execute.

There are also if statements and loops, but
try not to get too carried away.
