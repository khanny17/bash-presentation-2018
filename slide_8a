-- alias --


You can create an "alias" in your bashrc for
commands you run frequently.

If you find yourself typing out the same
long command the same way every time, consider
making an alias for it!


`in ~/.bashrc`:
    alias cf="ps aux | grep"
    alias tmux="tmux -2"
    alias gmm="gmakemake > Makefile"

    ...and so on and forth...
