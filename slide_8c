-- Bare Minimum .vimrc --

I really couldn't care less if you use vim or not,
but if you are going to, please PLEASE put at least
these lines into a file called `~/.vimrc`

    syntax on       " turn on syntax highlighting
    set number      " turn on line numbers
    set mouse=a     " enable the mouse
    set backspace=2 " make backspace work normally

You can also consider playing with your colorscheme
to get something that you think is easier on the
eyes:

    colorscheme desert " change colorscheme
